## The Task

 * Make a form according to mockup: 
   https://dribbble.com/shots/1322677-Checkout-Page/attachments/186093
 * Use only HTML & CSS, no JavaScript.  
 * Form elements should be clickable and respond to user action.  
 * The look should be as close as possible to mockup.  
 * Test the result in all available browsers & on different devices.  
 * Turn off CSS styling and check how your form looks and 
   if it is still usable.

### Notes from mock-up author
 
 > The top panel (order summary + help) will be sticky and lively
 updated as the user go through the form. New steps will be 
 revealed progressively.
